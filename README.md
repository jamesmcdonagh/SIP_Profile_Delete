# What is a SIP Profile?
A SIP Profile is a SIP user account that contains all of the configuration and user data for your Skype Connect™ service. You can set up multiple SIP Profiles specific to the needs of your business by creating separate Profiles for different departments and teams and manage the elements of those SIP Profiles according to business need and budget.

# A SIP Profile has six elements:

SIP credentials
These are the authentication details needed by your SIP-enabled PBX to connect to Skype.
Skype Credit
Skype Credit is required to pay for any outbound calls.
A monthly Skype Connect Channel subscription
This determines the number of simultaneous calls that are supported by Skype Connect.
Business Skype accounts
You can add these to your SIP Profile to receive calls from Skype in your SIP-enabled PBX, if required.
Skype Numbers
You can add these to your SIP Profile to receive calls from landlines and mobiles, if required.
Caller ID
This can be any Skype Number you have associated with your SIP Profile or, if your company has been verified, any landline number.
To display the details of a SIP Profile:

# Sign in to Skype Manager™.
Click Features in the toolbar.
In the menu on the left, click Skype Connect.
Scroll to the SIP Profile whose details you are interested in and click View profile next to its name.
